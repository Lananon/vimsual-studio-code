# VIMSUAL STUDIO CODE
the worst nvim config youll ever see :3

Ever wanted to use neovim without using neovim?
Youre in luck because thats exactly what this config does :3
Start in insert mode, use keybinds and features youd typically find in regular text editors, never have to enter normal mode

This config is inefficient, full of bad habits, and other things ;3
